#### JSTic-Tac-Toe

Just a little JavaScript/jQuery practice to implement Tic-Tac-Toe.

#### Installation

Seriously?  Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

#### Game play

Click on a square to place your mark.  The current player's turn is shown at the top.  There is a button at the bottom for starting a new game.

#### Implementation details

The program stores a 2D array to check for victory.  Marks are added to the html display in parallel to the updating of this game state, in direct violation of MVC and separation-of-concerns.

#### Is there a mobile-optimized version of this?

Go away.

#### License?

In light of the *grave* threat from possible *leeching* off my *hard* work, I have placed this under the MIT license.
